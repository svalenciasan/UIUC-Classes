## Team Members: fcoron5, svalen27, ada6, abdisl2

### Week of 4/6/21:
This week was the begining of the project so we set out to make a team contract and proposal, both of those were completed.
* Start of project.
* Created Team Contract.
* Created Team Proposal.
### Week of 4/12/21:
This week we set out to set up the project and begin working on some of the algorithms or traversal. We ended up setting up the project and began work on figuring out PageRank.
* Reviewed "Team Proposal" and edited it.
* Set up project structure: Added catch files, Makefile, test file, and datasets.
* Created readFromFile and added test cases.
* Researched and wrote pseudo code for PageRank Algorithm.
### Week of 4/19/21:
This week we set out to get the data structure as a basis for our project. We ended up getting both the Graph and Edge data structure mostly finished but untested. We also worked on a draft for the Traversal and the PageRank Algorithm.
* Created Graph and Edge data structure.
* Improved Makefile.
* Tweaks to insertEdge function.
* Draft of Traversal class.
* Draft of PageRank Algorithm.
## Week of 4/26/21:
This week we set out to make progress on the algorithms and Traversal. We ended up fixing a lot of errors with the Traversal class and drafted up the ++ operator.
* Traversal progess.
* Fixed readFromFile and tests.
## Week of 5/3/21:
This week we set out to fix issues with our testing not working and finish the Traversal and Algorithms. We ended up getting both the Traversal and PageRank algorithms done as well as Dijkstras from start to finish.
* Completed ++ operator for traversal.
* Switched to enum logic for traversal.
* Fixed up major issues with Makefile which prevented testing from working.
* Added testing for graph structure.
* Added loadFromFile to graph and tested.
* Added iterator tests.
* Updated PageRank to handle sink nodes and added testing.
* Added shortest path (BFS) and PageRank demonstrations to `main.cpp`
## Week of 5/10/21:
Our goal this week is to finish our presentation and get our peer reviews in.
