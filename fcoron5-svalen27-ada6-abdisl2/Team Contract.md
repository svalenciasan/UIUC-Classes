### **Team Contract (fcoron5-svalen27-ada6-abdisl2)**


### **Communication**



*   Meet Dates: Tuesday(7:00pm), Saturday(11am).
*   Meet Duration: 1hr 30min
*   Meetings/Communication: Through Discord to keep track of progress.
*   We will have a checkup on every member and their progress during meetings. Discord group chat will be used to effectively communicate with each other and share progress or ask questions. Members should respond to tags or DM’s in at most 24hrs.


### **Collaboration**



*   Work Distribution: We will have a meeting to discuss the distribution of work that every team member should complete before every meeting and checkpoint. Work will be distributed based on interests and difficulty, people with easier tasks might be given more stuff to work on than people with simpler tasks.
*   Time Commitment: It is expected for every team member to work on the project for at least about 3 hours a week. We will have to account for each team member's previous time commitments before organizing time to work together on the project. It is the team’s responsibility to solve time conflicts within the group. However, if a student consistently doesn’t show up to meetings then they will politely be asked for an explanation and depending on the circumstances the situation could potentially be brought up with a staff member.
*   Conflict Resolution: When there is a disagreement, we will put things to a vote between the group, and in case of a tie it will be settled with Rock Paper Scissors best 2/3. We will try to solve any issues internally and remind ourselves that we are a team. In cases of members slacking off, we will hold each other accountable and remind each other of our roles.
